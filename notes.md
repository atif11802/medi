## First of all i want to say i have been doing React js for more than 5 months.
So i haven't started TypeScript. i did this whole project using JavaScript.


## https://atif11802.github.io/medi/

You can open the project using this Link 
but it may not open because above link is https and provided api is in http mode.
To open the project go to site project and in browser setting allow insecure content.
(in top SITE Searchbar there will be a Lock icon press it then you will find site settings and allow insecure content)

##  I have made this Website Ui using Material UI.
because MUi povides good modern looking UI.And many React websites use the MUI technology and it is easy and free

## For overlay dialog i used MUI.

## For requesting and posting api i haved used api.
Because axios is modern technology so i choosed Axios.

## for Persist Logged in the website

when  User logged in for the first time then user data get stored in the  Local storage.
