You can open the project using this Link 
but it may not open because avobe link is https and provided api is in http mode.
To open the project go to site project and allow insecure content.

##  I have made this Website Ui ising Material UI.
because MUi povides good looking UI.

## For overlay dialog i used MUI.

## For requesting and posting api i haved used api.
Because axios is modern technology so i choosed Axios.

## for Persist Logged in the website

when the User logged in for the first time then user data get stored in the  Local storage.
